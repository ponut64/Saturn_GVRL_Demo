1. This converts .OBJ files to the game's .GVP format.
This tool itself was modified/converted from early versions of XL2's ZTP converter.
It is not complete; many changes will probably happen to it and the format.
So if you want more features, fork it or otherwise make your own format.

2. This tool DOES NOT export SGL-compatible data, nor does it export ZTP data.

3. The palette file in this folder is for converting RGB textures into indexed color textures.
You will note it only has 64-colors, and it also is not exactly the same palette file loaded on Saturn.
This is because the textures are expected to be drawn in "64 color bank mode", which has 64 unique colors.
The palette loaded on Saturn should incude these 64 colors in four different shades used for lighting.
Them's the beans you get for trying to make something work in Hi-res mode.

5. If you want, you can give the converter tool images that are already in indexed color.
In this case, it WILL NOT check final color of the textue AT ALL. It will simply copy the color index.

6. All textures must be targa format with RLE disabled.

4. The converter tool does not auto-exit. Type in any key, then press enter, and it will exit.
